## Part 3 - Fork

Start with a 80 mm circle, extruded 8 mm thick.  Then a 40 mm x 5 mm rectangle, 15 mm from the center.  Extrude that 75mm.  Then add 15 mm fillets to the top.  Some more 1 mm images to smooth things out.  Mirror that.  Then poke a 10 mm hole through the fork legs, 15 mm from the top.  A 60 mm tube on the other side, 15 mm ID, 20 mm OD.  Finally, a 1 mm chamfer.

# Parts 6-9 - Washer, Bearing, Collar, Axle

The washer, collar, and axle should be in the tire and wheel Part Studio.  The washer is just one feature, a cylinder with an ID of 10 mm and an OD of 25 mm.  It's 5 mm thick. 

The collar is two features.  The first feature is a cylinder, ID = 10 mm.  OD = 15 mm.  Thickness = 10 mm.  Then a 3 mm hole through one side.  

The axle is two features, starting with a cylinder, OD = 10 mm, ID = 6 mm, and 60 mm long.  Then a small cutout 4.5 mm from the center, 10 mm deep.  Mirror that to the other side.

Finally, make a bearing in the fork Part Studio.  Just one feature, a cylinder.  ID = 20 mm.  OD = 30 mm.  Thickness = 5mm.
